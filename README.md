# 📊 Interactive Curve Fitting 🧮

Welcome to the Interactive Curve Fitting project! This web application allows you to visualize and experiment with polynomial regression in real-time. 🚀

## 🌟 Features

- 📈 Interactive data input
- 🔢 Adjustable polynomial degree
- ⏱️ Customizable iteration time
- 📉 Real-time curve fitting visualization
- 📐 Area calculation under the curve
- 🎨 Modern, responsive design

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- No additional installations required! 🎉

### Running the Application

1. 📂 Download the HTML file
2. 🖱️ Double-click the file to open it in your default web browser
3. 🎈 That's it! You're ready to start fitting curves

## 🧑‍🏫 How to Use

1. 📝 Enter your data points in the textarea:
   - One point per line
   - Format: `x,y` (e.g., `1,2`)

2. 🔢 Set the maximum polynomial degree (default is 4)

3. ⏱️ (Optional) Set the iteration time in seconds (default is 1 second)

4. 🖱️ Click "Calculate Fit" to start the curve fitting process

5. 👀 Watch as the curve adjusts in real-time to fit your data!

6. 📊 The current polynomial equation and area under the curve will be displayed below the graph

7. 🔄 Want to try a quick example? Click the "Run Example" button!

## 📘 Understanding the Output

- 🔵 Blue dots: Your original data points
- 🔴 Red line: The fitted polynomial curve
- 📝 Equation: The polynomial equation is shown below the graph
- 🔢 Area: The area under the curve from x=0 to the maximum x-value is calculated and displayed

## 🛠️ Customization

Feel free to modify the HTML file to adjust:

- 🎨 Colors and styles (using Tailwind CSS classes)
- 📊 Chart options (using Chart.js configuration)
- 🧮 Polynomial regression algorithm (in the JavaScript code)
